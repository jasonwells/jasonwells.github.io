[Insight by Ryan at 37signals](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2316-so-much-complexity-in-software-comes-from) (via [minimalmac](http://minimalmac.com/post/574302966/so-much-complexity-in-software-comes-from-trying))

Echos the same sentiments as 37signalsâ€™ book Rework. An excellent read I just finished. I highly recommend it.
