## [A Lesser Photographer: The Photo Bubble](http://alesserphotographer.com/post/773244524/the-photo-bubble)

> Bubbles are usually reserved for complex products that most regular people own, and, now, more and more regular people are carrying powerful cameras (their phones) in their pockets wherever they go. The thing I’ve noticed is that they’re doing so without regard to the specs. They want a good picture (a result). That’s it. They exist comfortably outside the bubble, almost unaware the bubble exists.

I couldn’t agree more. Tech blogs and news sites however, are increasingly living inside these bubbles. I have made a concerted effort as of late to move myself out of these bubbles and into a world where I have essential tools that perform well.

Update: Here are two places, other than A Lesser Photographer, that have helped to inspire me in that direction recently:
